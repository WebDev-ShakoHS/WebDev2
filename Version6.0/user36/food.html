                    New Zealand cuisine has also been influenced by the foods of immigrants and the expectations of
                    international tourists. It was originally a combination of traditional British dishes with local
                    delicacies. Fresh seafood was popular along the coasts; mutton, venison, and meat pies were common.
                    Pavlova, a sweet meringue dish, was and remains a popular dessert. Food, however, has become more
                    imaginative and cosmopolitan, and there are many restaurants, bistros, and cafés in the major cities
                    and towns that present a range of classic and ethnic menus. A traditional Māori feast of meat,
                    seafood, and vegetables is steamed for hours in an earthen oven (hāngī).
                    <br>
                    Summer sees many eating outdoors in cafes or at barbecues - barbecues are a big part of the Kiwi
                    culture, and typify the laid-back nature of the New Zealand people - where fare such as lamb,
                    cervena (venison), crayfish (lobster), fresh fish and shellfish is plentiful. New Zealanders are
                    spoilt for their choice of fresh produce, choose a world class sauvignon blanc or chardonnay from
                    one of the country's 376 wineries, and you have the perfect complement.

                                Wine and food festivals are held annually in Auckland, Hawke's Bay, Martinborough,
                                Nelson, Canterbury and Queenstown.
                                These unique festivals bring a range of different wines and food together, highlighting
                                how well wine can complement all sorts of different New Zealand cuisine and food.
                                These events are a good way to have a fun day out with the family. As well as wonderful
                                New Zealand cuisine and wine, there is plenty of playground areas for children and
                                musical entertainment.

                                For the outgoing and brave people who are willing to try anything, the Wildfoods
                                Festival is something you can't miss. Anything unusual and extreme is on the list of
                                things to try.

                                Held every year in Hokitika, this festival is all about celebrating New Zealand's wild
                                foods from New Zealand. People from New Zealand and the globe come to Hokitika every
                                year to join in on this celebration of food. The Wildfoods Festival has become so
                                popular that it has gone on to win awards and accolades.

                                Stalls show off all types of odd but interesting food of New Zealand. Everything from
                                sheep's eyes to bug larvae, wild highland beef, curried Hoki Tikka, pesto ice-cream,
                                mountain merino and venison tongue are all on the list of things you can try.

                                If eating wild food isn't your thing, you can still enjoy the entertainment and stage
                                performances around the festival arena.

                <h3>History of New Zealand Food</h3>
                <p> Pavlova is a meringue-based dessert named after the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. It has a
                    crisp crust and soft, light inside, usually topped with fruit and whipped cream.[2] The name is
                    pronounced /pævˈloʊvə/, or like the name of the dancer, which was /ˈpɑːvləvə/.

                    The dessert is believed to have been created in honour of the dancer either during or after one of
                    her tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s. The nationality of its creator has been a
                    source of argument between the two nations for many years.

                    'The pav' is a popular dish and an important part of the national cuisine of both Australia and New
                    Zealand, and with its simple recipe, is frequently served during celebratory and holiday meals. It
                    is a dessert most identified with the summer time, and popularly eaten during that period, including
                    at Christmas time; however, it is also eaten all year round in many Australian and New Zealand
                    homes.
                    <br>
                    Seafood was a major part of the traditional Māori diet and is still enjoyed in the 2000s.

                    European settlers saw seafood as a food of the poor, though many still ate it. Only a small
                    proportion of edible fish species were eaten. In 1971 the New Zealand Fishing Industry Board was
                    established to encourage people to eat more fish, and more species of fish.

                    Oysters have long been popular with both Māori and Pākehā. Other seafood such as crayfish and
                    mussels became more sought after in the later 20th century.
