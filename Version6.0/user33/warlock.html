                    <h3>PvP Potential</h3>
                    <p>Every class in Destiny 2 can dominate in the Crucible with the right build and playstyle, but none of them have the level of outplay potential that a Warlock brings to the table. A skilled Warlock player can have enemy teams second-guess
                        their positioning or unleash devastating Supers every minute. </p>

                    <p>Attunement of Sky is arguably the strongest PvP spec in Destiny 2, allowing Warlocks to take to the sky with ease. With their perfect in-air accuracy, Warlocks can reign death from on high with their Celestial Fire melee ability or
                        accurate weapons, making the enemy team uncertain of which angles are safe. When things get tough, Sky Warlocks can dash into cover and deploy a Rift, turning a gunfight on its head.</p>

                    <p>Attunement of Control is also a highly used spec, allowing Warlocks to cast a devastating beam of lightning every couple of minutes. Utilizing a high Intellect stat and the Geomag Stabilizers Exotic, Control Warlocks can earn their
                        Exotic in as short as two minutes initially. Summon a giant electric beam, kill the enemy team, then cancel it early to preserve 25% Super energy. With the right mods, Control Warlocks can cast their Super every one to two minutes.PvP

                    <h3>Support Ablities</h3>
                    <p> The Warlock class is a safe choice for anyone who likes to play as a support class or healer in other games. While not every spec is fully centered around support, every Warlock subclass has the ability to place a Rift on the ground
                        that provides a 20% damage buff or passive healing to anyone inside the Rift. </p>
                    <p>Dawnblade's Attunement of Grace spec is a full-on support subclass, allowing Warlocks to heal players with overcharged grenades and place a supercharged Rift as their Super. No other class in Destiny 2 can support allies quite as easily
                        as a Warlock.

                    <h3>Build Variety</h3>
                    <p> Build variety reigns supreme on Warlocks. Hunters and Titans have some unique builds of their own, although they can't match the sheer variety of what Warlocks can do. </p>
                    <p>Warlock builds can allow players to summon multiple ice turrets, create two weapons platforms that float around them, throw infinite grenades, become nigh-invincible by killing targets, and so much more. This sort of variety allows
                        Warlocks to dominate in PvE and PvP with enough skill and patience, making them a must for any difficult content.</p>
